Kale: Your UCLA Sustainability and Health companion

# How to run the application

*The 'kale' folder in the repository contains all the frontend code in Flutter including screens, widgets etc.* In order to run the app, open the folder under Android Studio or VS Code and click run.

*The 'hoth_backend' folder in the repository contains all the backend code too, which we have hosted on a GoDaddy Server for your convenience.* This backend consists of our web scraper, meal recommendation AI, and all APIs that we wrote for the app. In order to run the backend locally, upload the hoth_backend folder to the public_html or htdocs folder of an Apache server where Python is installed
